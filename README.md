## these are some of the projects that I didn't really understand what they are for but my prof. wanted me to help him in it
## he texted me to help him code some things into c++ and I am proud of it even if it's simple, I made it from scratch and sent it to him.
### these are the ones I made alone (but because my prof. liked them I decided to publish it here for me, at least. )
